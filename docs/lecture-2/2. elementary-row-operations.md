# Elementary Row Operation

## Solving a Linear System

- To solve a linear system, we perform operations:

  1. Multiply an equation by a nonzero constant
  2. Interchange two equations
  3. Add a constant multiple of an equation to another
     - $E_1 \mapsto E_1 + cE_2 = E_3$
     - $E_3 \mapsto E_3 + (-c)E_2 = E_1$
     - **Operations must be revertible**

## Solving a Linear System in terms of an Augmented Matrix

- In term of augmented matrix, they correspond to operations on the **rows** of the augmented matrix:
  1. Multiply a row by a nonzero constant (Type 1)
  2. Interchange two rows (Type 2)
  3. Add a constant multiple of a row to another row  (Type 3)
     - $R_1 \mapsto R_1 + cR_2 = R_3$
     - $R_3 \mapsto R_3 + (-c)R_2 = R_1$

- Operations are performed to simplify the linear system
