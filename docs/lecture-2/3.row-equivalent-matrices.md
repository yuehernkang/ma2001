# Row Equivalent Matrices

## Definition

> Two augmented matrices are said to be **row equivalent** if one can be obtained from the other by a **series of elementary row operations**

- $A \xrightarrow{\text{multiply a row by nonzero }c} B$  
  - $B \xrightarrow{\text{multiply a row by nonzero }1/c} A$

- $A \xrightarrow{\text{interchange two rows}} B$  
  - $B \xrightarrow{\text{interchange two rows again}} A$

- $A \xrightarrow{\text{add c times of row i to row j}} B$  
  - $B \xrightarrow{\text{add (-c) times of row i to row j}} A$

$A$ is row equivalent to $B$ $\hArr$ $B$ is row equivalent to $A$
  - $A = A_0 \rarr A_1 \rarr \dots \rarr A_{k-1} \rarr A_k = B$
  - $B = A_k \rarr A_{k-1} \rarr \dots \rarr A_1 \rarr A_0 = A$

## Theorem

### Theorem 1

Let $A,B,C$ be augmented matrices.

- $A$ is row equivalent to $A$  
- $A$ is row equlvalent to $B$
  - $\rArr B$ is row equivalent to $A$
- $A$ is row equivalent to $B$ & $B$ is row equivalent to $C$
  - $\rArr A$ is row equivalent to $C$

### Theorem 2

Let $A$ and $B$ be augmented matrices of two linear systems. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent.

- Then the corresponding linear systems have the same set of solutions.

### Question

Given an augmented matrix $A$, how to find a row equivalent augmented matrix $B$ which is of a **simple** (or the **simplest**) form?

If we convert the matrix $A$ to a relatively simple matrix $B$, then we may be able to solve the system, since both are row equivalent and they have the same set of solutions.âˆ‚

We need to know what it is meant by **simple** and how to go from the original matrix $A$ to a simple matrix form $B$.
