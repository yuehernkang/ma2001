# Gaussian Elimination

## Definition

Let $A$ and $R$ be augmented matrices.

- Suppose that $A$ is row equivalent to $R$
  - i.e. $R$ can be obtained from $A$ by a series of elementary row operations

- If $R$ is in row-echelon form,
  - $R$ is called a **row-echelon form** of $A$

- If $R$ is in reduced row-echelon form,
  - $R$ is called a **reduced row-echelon form** of $A$

- Solving a linear system with augmented matrix $A$
    $\hArr$ Solving a linear system with augmented matrix $R$
  - They have the same solutions!

## Algorithm

Simply using elementary row operations to reduce an augmented matrix to row-echelon form.

1. Find the leftmost column which is not entirely zero.
2. If the top entry of such column is 0,
   - Then replace it by a nonzero number by interchanging the top row with another row
3. For each row below the top row,
   - Add a suitable multiple of the top row to it so that its leading entry becomes $0$.
4. Cover the top row and repeat the procedure to the remaining matrix.
   - Continue until the entire matrix is in row-echelon form
