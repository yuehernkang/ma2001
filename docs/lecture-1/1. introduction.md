# Introduction

Definition of **Linear**:

- Study **lines**, **planes** and **objects** which are geometrically 'flat'
- The real world is too complicated, therefore, we use 'flat' (linear) objects to approximate the real world

Definition of **Algebra**:

- The objects are not as simple as numbers
- Operations are not limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

For Calculus, any problem we can plot on the plane. However, for Linear Algebra, in higher dimensional spaces, there is no way we can visualize the picture.
