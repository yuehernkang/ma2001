# Linear Systems

A **Linear System** (**system of linear equations**) of $m$ linear equations in $n$ variables $x_z, x_z \dots, x_n$ is

- $\begin{cases}
    a_{11}x_{1} + a_{12}x_{2} + \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1,
    \\ a_{21}x_{1} + a_{22}x_{2} + \dots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2,
    \\ \vdots
    \\ a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \dots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m,
\end{cases}$
  - where $a_{ij}$ and $b_i$ are real constants.
    - $a_{ij}$ is the **coefficient** of $x_j$ in the $i$th equation,
    - $b_i$ is the **constant term** of the $i$th equation.
- If all $a_{ij}$ and $b_{i}$ are zero,
  - the linear system is called a **zero system**
- If some $a_{ij}$ or $b_i$ is non-zero,
  - the linear system is called a **non-zero system**
- If $x_1 = s_1, x_2 = s_2, \dots, x_n=s_n$ is a solution to **every equation** of the linear system, then it is called a **solution** to the system
  - The **solution set** is the set of all solutions to the linear system
  - A **general solution** is an expression which generates the solution set of the linear system

## Example

- Linear system $\begin{cases} 
    4x_{1} - x_2 + 3x_3 = -1, \\
    4x_1+x_2+9x_3 = -4,
\end{cases}$

  - $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = -1$ is a solution to both equations, then it is a solution to the system
  - $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 8, x_3 = 1$ is a solution to the **first equation**, but not a solution to the **second equation**, we **cannot** say this is a solution to the linear system

## Consistency

- In a linear system, even if every equation has a solution, there may not be a solution to the system. 
  - Example: 
    - $\begin{cases}
        x + y = 4 \\
        2x+2y=6
    \end{cases}$
    - $2x + 2y = 6 \rArr x+y=3$
    - $x + y = 4$ **&** $x+y=3 \rArr 4 = 3$, impossible !

- A linear system is called
  - **consistent** if it has at least one solution
  - **inconsistent** if it has no solution

- A linear system has either
  - no solution,
  - exactly one solution,
  - infinitely many solutions
  - **because the result must be geometrically flat !**

## Examples 

### Parallel Lines

- Linear system in variables $x,y$ of two equations: 
- $\begin{cases}
  a_1x + b_1y = c_1, (L1)\\
  a_2x + b_2y = c_2, (L2)\\
\end{cases}$
- Assume $a_1, b_1$ are not both zero, $a_2, b_2$ are not both zero.
- In the $xy$-plane, each equation represents a straight line.

- $L1$(red) and $L2$(black) are parallel lines, but they are distinct
- The system has **no solution**, as they are distinct parallel lines 
- In MA2001 context, L1 can be **parallel** to itself

### Lines crossing one another at one point
  
- Linear system in variables $x,y$ of two equations:
- $\begin{cases}
  a_1x + b_1y = c_1, (L1) \\
  a_2x + b_2y = c_2, (L2)
\end{cases}$ 
- Assume $a_1, b_1$ are not both zero, $a_2, b_2$ are not both zero.
- In the $xy$-plane, each equation represents a straight line.
- <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i1xhsmilec?embed" width="500" height="500"></iframe>
- The system has exactly one solution
  - $\rArr$ $L1$ & $L2$ are not parallel

### Linear system in 3D space

1. Parallel Planes (No Solution)

   - Linear system in variables $x,y,z$ of two equations:
     - $\begin{cases}
         a_1x + b_1y+c_1z=d_1, (P1) \\
         a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2, (P2)
     \end{cases}$
   - Assume $a_1, b_1, c_1$ are not all zero, and $a_1, b_2, c_2$ are not all zero.
     - Each equation represents a plane in $xyz$-space 

     - The system has no solution
     - $P1$ and $P2$ are parallel but distinct

2. Same plane (Infinitely many solutions)

    - Linear system in variables $x,y,z$ of two equations:
      - $\begin{cases}
          a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=d_1, (P1) \\
          a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2, (P2)
      \end{cases}$
     - Assume $a_1, b_1, c_1$ are not all zero, and $a_1, b_2, c_2$ are not all zero.
      - ![Parallel Planes](https://i.imgur.com/ELnXmE4.png)
      - The system has **infinitely many solutions**
        - if $P1$ and $P2$ are the same plane

3. 2 Planes intersect (Infinitely many solutions)
    - Linear system in variables $x,y,z$ of two equations:
      - $\begin{cases}
          a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=d_1, (P1) \\
          a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2, (P2)
      \end{cases}$     
    - Assume $a_1, b_1, c_1$ are not all zero, and $a_1, b_2, c_2$ are not all zero.
      - Each equation represents a plane in the $xyz$-space.
      - The system has infinitely many solutions
        - If $P1$ and $P2$ intersect at a straight line

### How to check if they represent the same plane? 

1. Same Plane

   - See the ratio of $a_1$ : $a_2$ = $b_1$ : $b_2$ = $c_1$ : $c_2$ = $d_1$ : $d_2$ are proportional

2. Parallel Planes

    - $\hArr a_1 : a_2 = b_1 : b_2 = c_1 : c_2$ are proportional
    - Without $d$

3. Intersect

    - $\hArr a_1 : a_2, b_1 : b_2, c_1 : c_2$ are not all the sames
